## Introduction
This Jupyter notebook is **an exploration of COVID-19 data** provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
It demonstrates the power of the Pandas library to perform:

- Preliminary analysis.

>The notebook is intended to test the power of jupyter notebook. Other Repos will be added showcasing some of my work in Data analysis
